# Acknowlegement

The algorithm in this file is based on the following paper: 
W. Wang, N. Chen, X. Chen and L. Yang, "A Variational Inference-based Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Approach for Simulation Metamodeling".

- The code in this file is based on the MATLAB package given by 
http://www.tsc.uc3m.es/~miguel/downloads.php, see code for "Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression", Code and demo for VHGP, including a volatility example. Many thanks to M. Lazaro Gredilla and M. Titsias for their work  "Variational Heteroscedastic Gaussian Process Regression" published in ICML 2011.

- Some of the covariance functions are based on GPML Matlab Code version 4.2 http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/ that originally demonstrated the main algorithms from Rasmussen and Williams: Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning.
